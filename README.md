# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This is the frontend client for the website "Table Top Town", which is usually hosted at tabletoptown.herokuapp.com.

### Features

Table Town Town features a functioning frontend client that sends/receives data to/from a node.js server (currently hosted at tttserver.herokuapp.com), and that server in turn sends/receives data to a MongoDB database.

### Current To-do List

Create a register/signup user functionality, which needs to also be done separately on the backend as well.

Implement more pages of JavaScript-created interactive games.
